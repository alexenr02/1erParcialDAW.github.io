    <li>
      <span style="font-weight:bold"">Jun 28, 1971 </span> Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa. As a child, Musk was so lost in his daydreams 
      about inventions that his parents and doctors ordered a test to check his hearing.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      <span style="font-weight:bold"">1971</span> At age 17 Musk moved to Canada to attend Queen’s University and avoid mandatory service in the South African military. Musk obtained his Canadian citizenship that year, 
      in part because he felt it would be easier to obtain American citizenship via that path.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      <span style="font-weight:bold"">1995</span> Musk launched his first company, Zip2 Corporation, in 1995 with his brother, Kimbal Musk. An online city guide, Zip2 was soon providing content for the new 
      websites of both The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune. 
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      <span style="font-weight:bold"">2002</span> Musk founded his third company, Space Exploration Technologies Corporation, or SpaceX, with the intention of building spacecraft for commercial space travel. By 2008, 
      SpaceX was well established, and NASA awarded the company the contract to handle cargo transport for the International Space Station—with plans for astronaut transport in the future—in a move to replace NASA’s own space shuttle missions.
